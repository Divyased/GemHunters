 # Gem Hunters 
 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Gem Hunters is a console based 2D game where the players with most number of gems will be the winner.

There will be 6*6 square board with player 1 in the top left corner and player 2 in the bottom right corner of the board. 

Gems (G) and obstacles (O) will be randomly placed on the board and they will not change once we place them. 

There are total 30 turns where player 1 and player 2 get 15 turns each alternatively. Players can move Upwards (U), downwards (D),left (L), and Right (R) directions.

They cannot move diagonally and also cannot pass through the obstacles as well.

When a player move into the sqaure that contains gem, they collect that gem and the gem will be removed from the board and that space becomes empty.

And the player who collects the most number of gems will be the winner and if both the players collect the same number of gems, then it will be declared as a tie.
